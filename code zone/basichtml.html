	<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the easiest way to code a webpage yourself! It is the document type that creates all of the pages that you see on the World Wide Web. It is a versatile engine that is the backbone of the modern internet. One reason why HTML is so accessible is that it doesn't require any software to make pages yourself! There are free options like Notepad++, but you can start writing code anywhere! Just follow the format and you'll be fine.<p>
    <p>While it is very easy to manipulate and code HTML, there is some basic formatting and syntax, as with all languages. Every webpage starts with an opening tag. This tends to be the type of document you are creating. The syntax for the start of a web page is &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. Another element that you must include is the &lt;html&gt; tag. This is a double-sided tag, so at the end of the page, you need to close it. That means what you write in between the opening and the closing tag will be included in that section. The closing tag officially ends that section of the code. You can do that by using &lt;/html&gt;. Most tags consist of an opening &lt;&gt; and closing &lt;/&gt; tags, with space in between the carrots being the tag name. However, there are solo tags as well, such as &lt;br&gt;, which puts a line break in your text, like this. <br> The break tag doesn't have a closing, because it doesn't contain any information, it just inserts a line break. </p>
    <p>Other tags you would want to include in your page are &lt;head&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;. You put all the information in between those opening and closing tags. In the head, you can put the title of your page and some other extra information. The header is the topmost section of your page, ours consists of the computer gif and, on this page, "Basic HTML". Within the body, you include nav, main and the footer. The navigation area has your pages organized so users can move around. In main you can put the bulk of your information and explain what the page is about. A footer can include the copyright, your name and the date the page was created.</p>
    <p>Here's a very simple example of a webpage. Let's play a game, see how many of the tags you can find that we just talked about, and maybe see if you can take this general idea and create your own page! If you want to see the HTML code for this page, just right-click on the background and select "inspect page source", our code will open up for you!</p>
