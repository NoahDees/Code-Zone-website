	<p>As with most things in life, HTML has some rules. While most of them aren't incredibly strict, it doesn't hurt to try and follow them anyway, to make your page look and be its best. The best practices are general schools of thought that most agree will help make your page accessible, compatible and functional. There are many places you can find many lists of best practices, but <a href="https://terrymorris.net/bestpractices/">Terry Morris</a> has an all-encompassing one. If you would like to know all of her suggestions, go right on ahead, we're going to give you a condensed version of her list to get you started on your HTML journey. </p>
    <p>First up is page layout, you want to make sure your pages are consistent and easily navigated. Our site is a pretty good example, we have our computer gif in the top left, the title hovering to the right of the gif and the information in the middle. Every page is the same, that way even if you lose where you are, it's familiar enough that you can find your way somewhere else. You also want to pay attention to colors, negative spaces, and pictures you might have. There's also browser compatibility, your friends might prefer one browser but you like another and each is going to display the page differently. Making sure your site looks good regardless of where it's looked at is important. There are billions of people in the world and you never know which browser they use, so test your page on them all!</p>

    <p>The navigation area, ours is just to the left of this text, is one of the most crucial areas of a website. If someone can't find their way around your site they're not going to want to visit it. So you do make a navigation area, now don't forget to test it to make sure it works and takes you to the right pages. Color is important to setting a theme for your site and giving it life. Our site is trying to model the old terminal computers from the 60s to the 80s. That's why we chose a dark black background with the green text, those colors won't work on every site, just because of the purpose they might be trying to serve. We were also careful to make our links and other text colors bright too, if we had chosen a grey or navy it would have been impossible to read. Speaking of the old computers, we attached an image for you to see, and that image serves a purpose. You want to make sure you're not putting pictures or videos for no reason, your site should look like it was put together with a vision in mind. </p>
    <p>Accessibility makes sure that everyone can use your site. Including alternate text for images, captions for files and videos and contrast with your colors. Always make sure your website is looking out for others who may use text to speech programs. Last, make sure everything works, test your site and then test it again. Have your friends test it, have them test it in the dumbest ways. Make sure no matter what someone puts in a form it will work as you want it to. </p>
